#include <iostream>
//iostream is a header file for basic IO input and output operations

int main(void){
    std::cout <<"I like Pizza" << std::endl;//standard:: end-line. Endline flushes the output
    std::cout <<"I REALLY LIKE PIZZA";
    // << means output
    //std means standard. cout means C-output
    return 0;
